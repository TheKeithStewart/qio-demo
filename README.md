# QIO Demo

## Browser Compatiblity Issues

## UX Design

- Should not convey what something represents with only color, a symbol should be used as well
- Add tooltips to better describe what elements mean
    * I would probably use a better looking tooltip than I have (i.e. paper-tooltip)
- aria labels for upload time, warning counts, and error counts to describe what they represent for screen readers

## UI Design

- Group together warnings and errors with the appropriate file info
- Place buttons at the bottom of the form
- Add box shaddow around box to make it stand out a little better
